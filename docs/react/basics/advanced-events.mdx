# ⚡ Advanced Event Handling in React

After mastering basic events like `onClick` and `onChange`, it's time to explore more **advanced interactions**.

---

## ⌨️ Keyboard Events

React provides events for key presses, such as `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, and `onKeyPress`.

```jsx live
function KeyPressExample() {
  const handleKeyPress = (e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter') {
      alert('Enter key pressed!');
    }
  };

  return <input type='text' onKeyDown={handleKeyPress} placeholder='Press Enter...' />;
}
```

---

## 👀 Focus and Blur Events

These are used to detect when a component gains or loses focus.

```jsx live
function FocusBlurExample() {
  return (
    <input
      onFocus={() => console.log('Focused')}
      onBlur={() => console.log('Blurred')}
      placeholder='Click in and out of me'
    />
  );
}
```

## 🌐 Event Propagation (Bubbling & Capturing)

React events bubble by default. You can **stop propagation** using `e.stopPropagation()`.

```jsx live
function PropagationExample() {
  const handleOuterClick = () => alert('Outer clicked');
  const handleInnerClick = (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    alert('Inner clicked');
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={handleOuterClick} style={{ padding: '20px', background: '#eee' }}>
      <button onClick={handleInnerClick}>Click Inner</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 🧠 Synthetic Events

React wraps native events with its **SyntheticEvent** system for cross-browser consistency.

:::info
Synthetic events normalize behavior across browsers and pool for performance — but beware when using them asynchronously.

## 🎯 Event Delegation

React handles event delegation **automatically** using the virtual DOM, so you don’t need to attach individual listeners to every DOM node manually.
