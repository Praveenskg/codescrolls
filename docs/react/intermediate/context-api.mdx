# 🧩 React Context API

React's Context API is a way to manage **global state** across your app — like theme, auth, or user preferences — without passing props manually at every level.

---

## 📦 Why Use Context?

- Avoid **prop drilling**
- Share state/data globally
- Simple alternative to Redux or Zustand for small/medium apps

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Create a context**
2. **Wrap your app with a Provider**
3. **Consume with `useContext` hook**

---

## ✍️ Create & Provide Context

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

// 1. Create Context
const ThemeContext = createContext();

// 2. Provider Component
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

  return <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>;
}
```

---

## 📥 Consume Context (Child Component)

```jsx
import { useContext } from 'react';

function ThemeSwitcher() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = React.useContext(ThemeContext);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light')}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 🧪 Putting it Together

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <ThemeSwitcher />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

---

## 🔁 Best Practices

- Keep Context small and focused (e.g. one for theme, one for auth)
- Avoid overusing Context for frequently changing data (can cause re-renders)
- Combine with `useReducer` for complex state logic

---

> 💡 **Context is perfect for global, read-heavy data**. For dynamic or large apps, you may consider libraries like Redux or Zustand.
