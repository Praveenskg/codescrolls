# Variables in TypeScript

TypeScript provides powerful static typing capabilities to JavaScript. When declaring variables, we can explicitly define their types to catch bugs early and improve developer experience.

---

## 1. Declaring Variables

Use `let`, `const`, or `var` (though `var` is discouraged in modern TypeScript).

```ts
let name: string = 'Alice';
const age: number = 25;
```

> Prefer const by default, use let if the variable will change.

---

## 2. Type Inference

TypeScript can infer the type if you initialize the variable with a value.

```ts
let language = 'TypeScript'; // inferred as string
let version = 4.9; // inferred as number
```

But explicitly adding types improves clarity:

```ts
let framework: string = 'React';
```

---

## 3. Explicit Typing

You can annotate the type manually, even if you donâ€™t initialize the variable immediately:

```ts
let isActive: boolean;
isActive = true;
```

---

## 4. Union Types

A variable can hold values of multiple types:

```ts
let value: string | number;
value = 'Hello';
value = 42;
```

---

## 5. Any Type (Avoid if possible)

Using `any` disables type checking:

```ts
let data: any = 'Text';
data = 123;
data = true;
```

> This removes all benefits of TypeScript. Use only when necessary.

---

## 6. Constant Declarations

Use const for immutable values:

```ts
const PI: number = 3.14159;
const appName = 'CodeScrolls'; // inferred as string
```

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Prefer const over let
- Avoid var
- Use explicit types where helpful
- Avoid any unless unavoidable
- Use union types when flexibility is needed
- Keep variable names meaningful and descriptive

---

## 8. Quick Examples

```ts
let isOnline: boolean = true;
let score: number = 100;
let userName: string = 'Praveen';
let tags: string[] = ['ts', 'js', 'node'];
let config: { darkMode: boolean } = { darkMode: true };
```

:::info Summary

- `let`, `const`, and type annotations help manage code safety.

- TypeScript's type system helps catch bugs early.

- Practice writing variables with and without inference.
