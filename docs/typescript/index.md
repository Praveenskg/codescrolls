# 🧠 Welcome to TypeScript Docs

TypeScript is a **typed superset of JavaScript** that adds static type-checking and advanced language features. Developed by **Microsoft**, it's designed to help you build more reliable and maintainable apps.

---

## 🚀 Why Use TypeScript?

- ✅ Enforces static typing for fewer runtime errors
- 💡 Autocomplete, refactoring, and better tooling
- 📦 Supports interfaces, enums, generics, and more
- 🔧 Ideal for large-scale and team-based projects
- 🌍 Seamlessly works with existing JavaScript libraries

---

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- 📄 Types, Interfaces & Type Aliases
- 🎯 Functions & Optional Parameters
- 🧩 Advanced Types (Unions, Intersections)
- 🧭 Generics for reusable components
- 🛠️ Module system & project setup
- 🔍 Compiler Options & Strict Modes
- 🧪 Integrating with React, Node.js, and existing codebases

---

## 🧭 Navigation Guide

Use the sidebar to walk through each topic in order:

- `types/` → primitive and advanced types
- `functions/` → typing functions & parameters
- `interfaces/` → defining contracts
- `generics/` → reusable, type-safe code
- `integration/` → using TypeScript in real projects

---

## 📚 Coming Next

We’ll soon add:

- 🛡️ TypeScript with React and Next.js
- 📏 Tools like ESLint, Prettier, and type-aware bundlers
- ⚙️ Unit testing with typed test suites

---

> 🚨 Prerequisite: Familiarity with JavaScript is recommended before diving into TypeScript.
