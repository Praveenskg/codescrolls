#  Node.js Interview Questions

Welcome to the **Node.js Interview Hub** ðŸš€\
Here you'll find a collection of **50 essential Node.js interview
questions** covering basic, intermediate, and advanced levels with
examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸŸ¢ Basic Level

### 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows
running JavaScript on the server.

``` js
console.log("Hello from Node.js");
```

### 2. What are the features of Node.js?

-   Non-blocking I/O\
-   Single-threaded event loop\
-   High scalability\
-   NPM ecosystem

### 3. What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) manages dependencies.

``` bash
npm install express
```

### 4. Difference between Node.js and JavaScript in browser?

-   Browser JS: Runs in browser, limited APIs (DOM).\
-   Node.js: Runs on server, access to file system, OS.

### 5. What is the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules?

-   CommonJS: `require`, `module.exports`.\
-   ES Modules: `import`, `export`.

``` js
// CommonJS
const fs = require("fs");
// ES Modules
import fs from "fs";
```

### 6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous in Node.js?

-   Sync: Blocks execution.\
-   Async: Non-blocking, event-driven.

### 7. What is REPL in Node.js?

Read-Eval-Print Loop interactive shell.

``` bash
node
> 2 + 3
5
```

### 8. What is package.json?

Configuration file containing dependencies, scripts, metadata.

### 9. What is difference between dependencies and devDependencies?

-   dependencies: Required in production.\
-   devDependencies: Required only in development.

### 10. What is difference between global and local modules?

-   Global: Installed with `-g`.\
-   Local: Installed in project `node_modules`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Level

### 11. What is event-driven architecture in Node.js?

Node.js uses event-driven architecture where the event loop handles
async operations.

### 12. Explain the Event Loop in Node.js.

Manages async operations with phases (timers, I/O, check, close).

### 13. What are callbacks in Node.js?

Functions passed as arguments, executed after async tasks.

``` js
fs.readFile("file.txt", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data.toString());
});
```

### 14. What are Promises in Node.js?

Alternative to callbacks for handling async operations.

``` js
fs.promises.readFile("file.txt").then(console.log);
```

### 15. Explain async/await in Node.js.

Syntactic sugar over Promises for cleaner async code.

``` js
async function read() {
  let data = await fs.promises.readFile("file.txt");
  console.log(data.toString());
}
```

### 16. What are streams in Node.js?

Streams handle reading/writing large data chunks efficiently.

``` js
const fs = require("fs");
const read = fs.createReadStream("file.txt");
read.on("data", chunk => console.log(chunk.toString()));
```

### 17. Explain the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?

-   nextTick: Runs before next event loop phase.\
-   setImmediate: Runs in the check phase.

### 18. What are Buffers in Node.js?

Buffers handle binary data.

``` js
const buf = Buffer.from("Hello");
console.log(buf.toString());
```

### 19. What is middleware in Express.js?

Functions that process requests before reaching routes.

``` js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Middleware");
  next();
});
```

### 20. Difference between `app.use()` and `app.get()` in Express?

-   app.use(): For middleware.\
-   app.get(): For handling GET routes.

### 21. What is CORS in Node.js?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows resources from different origins.

### 22. What are environment variables in Node.js?

Configuration variables stored in `.env`.

``` js
process.env.PORT;
```

### 23. What is difference between cluster and worker threads?

-   Cluster: Multi-process.\
-   Worker Threads: Multi-thread within a process.

### 24. What is Nodemon?

A tool that restarts Node.js app on file changes.

### 25. What is PM2?

A production process manager for Node.js apps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Level

### 26. What is difference between spawn, exec, and fork in Node.js?

-   spawn: Executes command, streams output.\
-   exec: Executes command, buffers output.\
-   fork: Creates new Node.js process.

### 27. What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking code?

-   Blocking: Stops execution until complete.\
-   Non-blocking: Async execution.

### 28. What is JWT authentication in Node.js?

JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication.

``` js
const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, "secret");
```

### 29. What is difference between authentication and authorization?

-   Authentication: Identity verification.\
-   Authorization: Access control.

### 30. What is rate limiting in Node.js?

Restricts number of requests per client.

### 31. What is Helmet in Node.js?

Middleware for securing HTTP headers.

### 32. What are cookies and sessions in Node.js?

-   Cookies: Client-side storage.\
-   Sessions: Server-side storage linked with cookies.

### 33. What are microservices in Node.js?

Architectural style splitting app into small independent services.
