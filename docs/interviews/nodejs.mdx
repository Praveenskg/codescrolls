# Node.js Interview Questions

Welcome to the **Node.js Interview Hub** 🚀\
Here you'll find a collection of **50 essential Node.js interview questions**
covering basic, intermediate, and advanced levels with examples.

---

## 🟢 Basic Level

### 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine that allows running
JavaScript on the server.

```js
console.log('Hello from Node.js');
```

### 2. What are the features of Node.js?

- Non-blocking I/O\
- Single-threaded event loop\
- High scalability\
- NPM ecosystem

### 3. What is NPM?

NPM (Node Package Manager) manages dependencies.

```bash
npm install express
```

### 4. Difference between Node.js and JavaScript in browser?

- Browser JS: Runs in browser, limited APIs (DOM).\
- Node.js: Runs on server, access to file system, OS.

### 5. What is the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules?

- CommonJS: `require`, `module.exports`.\
- ES Modules: `import`, `export`.

```js
// CommonJS
const fs = require('fs');
// ES Modules
import fs from 'fs';
```

### 6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous in Node.js?

- Sync: Blocks execution.\
- Async: Non-blocking, event-driven.

### 7. What is REPL in Node.js?

Read-Eval-Print Loop interactive shell.

```bash
node
> 2 + 3
5
```

### 8. What is package.json?

Configuration file containing dependencies, scripts, metadata.

### 9. What is difference between dependencies and devDependencies?

- dependencies: Required in production.\
- devDependencies: Required only in development.

### 10. What is difference between global and local modules?

- Global: Installed with `-g`.\
- Local: Installed in project `node_modules`.

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Level

### 11. What is event-driven architecture in Node.js?

Node.js uses event-driven architecture where the event loop handles async
operations.

### 12. Explain the Event Loop in Node.js.

Manages async operations with phases (timers, I/O, check, close).

### 13. What are callbacks in Node.js?

Functions passed as arguments, executed after async tasks.

```js
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data.toString());
});
```

### 14. What are Promises in Node.js?

Alternative to callbacks for handling async operations.

```js
fs.promises.readFile('file.txt').then(console.log);
```

### 15. Explain async/await in Node.js.

Syntactic sugar over Promises for cleaner async code.

```js
async function read() {
  let data = await fs.promises.readFile('file.txt');
  console.log(data.toString());
}
```

### 16. What are streams in Node.js?

Streams handle reading/writing large data chunks efficiently.

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const read = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
read.on('data', chunk => console.log(chunk.toString()));
```

### 17. Explain the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?

- nextTick: Runs before next event loop phase.\
- setImmediate: Runs in the check phase.

### 18. What are Buffers in Node.js?

Buffers handle binary data.

```js
const buf = Buffer.from('Hello');
console.log(buf.toString());
```

### 19. What is middleware in Express.js?

Functions that process requests before reaching routes.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware');
  next();
});
```

### 20. Difference between `app.use()` and `app.get()` in Express?

- app.use(): For middleware.\
- app.get(): For handling GET routes.

### 21. What is CORS in Node.js?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows resources from different origins.

### 22. What are environment variables in Node.js?

Configuration variables stored in `.env`.

```js
process.env.PORT;
```

### 23. What is difference between cluster and worker threads?

- Cluster: Multi-process.\
- Worker Threads: Multi-thread within a process.

### 24. What is Nodemon?

A tool that restarts Node.js app on file changes.

### 25. What is PM2?

A production process manager for Node.js apps.

## 🔴 Advanced Level

### 26. What is difference between spawn, exec, and fork in Node.js?

- spawn: Executes command, streams output.\
- exec: Executes command, buffers output.\
- fork: Creates new Node.js process.

### 27. What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking code?

- Blocking: Stops execution until complete.\
- Non-blocking: Async execution.

### 28. What is JWT authentication in Node.js?

JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication.

```js
const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id }, 'secret');
```

### 29. What is difference between authentication and authorization?

- Authentication: Identity verification.\
- Authorization: Access control.

### 30. What is rate limiting in Node.js?

Restricts number of requests per client.

### 31. What is Helmet in Node.js?

Middleware for securing HTTP headers.

### 32. What are cookies and sessions in Node.js?

- Cookies: Client-side storage.\
- Sessions: Server-side storage linked with cookies.

### 33. What are microservices in Node.js?

Architectural style splitting app into small independent services.

### 34. What is GraphQL in Node.js?

A query language for APIs alternative to REST.

### 35. What is difference between REST and GraphQL?

- REST: Fixed endpoints.\
- GraphQL: Flexible queries.

### 36. What is WebSocket in Node.js?

Protocol for real-time two-way communication.

### 37. What are child processes in Node.js?

Allow running other programs from Node.js.

### 38. What are worker threads in Node.js?

Provide parallel execution of JavaScript in multiple threads.

### 39. What is clustering in Node.js?

Using multiple processes to handle concurrent requests.

### 40. What is load balancing in Node.js?

Distributing requests across multiple servers.

### 41. What is difference between vertical and horizontal scaling in Node.js?

- Vertical: Increase resources of one server.\
- Horizontal: Add more servers.

### 42. What are design patterns in Node.js?

Singleton, Observer, Factory, Middleware pattern.

### 43. What is event emitter in Node.js?

Core module that allows custom events.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.on('msg', () => console.log('Hello'));
emitter.emit('msg');
```

### 44. What are process signals in Node.js?

Notifications like `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM` to manage processes.

### 45. What is difference between process.env and config files?

- process.env: Dynamic values from environment.\
- Config files: Static configurations.

### 46. What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous error handling?

### 49. What is difference between Redis and MongoDB in Node.js?

- Redis: In-memory store.\
- MongoDB: Document database.

### 50. What are best practices for Node.js applications?

- Use async/await\
- Secure environment variables\
- Error handling\
- Caching\
- Logging\
- Use process managers
