![React useEffect Cover](/img/blog/react.png)

React introduced Hooks in version 16.8 to make functional components powerful. Among them, `useEffect` is one of the most commonly used (and misunderstood) hooks.

- Basic Syntax
- useEffect as componentDidMount
- Cleanup Functions
- Dependency Array Explained
- Common Mistakes
- Real-world Examples

## What is `useEffect`?

`useEffect` lets you perform **side effects** in functional components — things like data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscriptions.

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // your side effect here
});
```

---

## Basic Syntax

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  // code to run
}, [dependencies]);
```

- The first argument is a callback function.
- The second argument is an optional dependency array.

---

## useEffect as `componentDidMount`

Run the effect only once when the component mounts:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Component mounted!');
}, []);
```

---

## useEffect on Dependency Update

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Count changed:', count);
}, [count]);
```

This runs only when `count` changes.

---

## Cleanup Function

Cleanup functions are used for unmounting or unsubscribing:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Tick');
  }, 1000);

  return () => {
    clearInterval(timer);
    console.log('Cleaned up!');
  };
}, []);
```

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting the dependency array**  
   This runs on every re-render, which might not be what you want.

2. **Using wrong dependencies**  
   If you use variables inside `useEffect`, they should be in the dependency array.

3. **Not cleaning up subscriptions**  
   Leads to memory leaks.

---

## Real-world Example: Fetching Data

```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchUsers() {
      const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');
      const data = await res.json();
      setUsers(data);
    }

    fetchUsers();
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

---

## Conclusion

`useEffect` is powerful but must be used carefully. Always understand **when** and **why** it's running. Once you master it, your functional components become truly powerful.
