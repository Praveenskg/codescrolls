## ✨ What This Blog Is About

This blog is all about exploring and mastering the world of web development — from the basics of **JavaScript**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, to tools, workflows, and productivity hacks. If you're a beginner trying to understand the fundamentals or a seasoned dev looking for quick references and tips, you're in the right place.

In this first post, I want to walk you through:

- ✅ Why I created **CodeScrolls**
- 📖 How to write content using **Markdown**
- 🧱 The basics of using **Docusaurus** for documentation and blogs
- 🚀 What’s coming next on this blog

## 🧠 Why CodeScrolls?

Over time, I realized how much we rely on scattered documentation, cheat sheets, and StackOverflow threads. **CodeScrolls** aims to bring everything together — structured, searchable, and beautifully organized.

Think of it as your digital second brain for all things dev.

## 📝 Writing with Markdown

Creating content in Docusaurus is incredibly fun and flexible. You write in Markdown, and it just works.
