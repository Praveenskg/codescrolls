# Top 10 VSCode Extensions for Web Developers

If you’re into web development and use VSCode (which most of us do), this post is for you.  
I used to work with plain VSCode for the longest time until I discovered these extensions — and they completely changed the way I code.

Here are the top 10 extensions every web developer should consider using:

---

## 1. Prettier – Code Formatter
Tired of messy code formatting? Prettier automatically formats your code whenever you save. No need to manually fix indentation, semicolons, or spacing — it handles everything.

**Use for:** Auto-formatting HTML, CSS, JS, TS  
**Extension ID:** `esbenp.prettier-vscode`

## 2. ESLint
Think your code is clean? ESLint will catch issues you might overlook. It enforces consistent coding standards and prevents common mistakes, especially in JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

**Use for:** Linting, best practices, bug prevention  
**Extension ID:** `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`

**Extension ID:** `bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`

## 4. Live Server

**Use for:** Real-time browser previews  
**Extension ID:** `ritwickdey.LiveServer`

## 5. Path Intellisense
Forget the exact path to a file? This extension auto-suggests paths while importing, making navigation faster and easier.

**Use for:** Smart file path autocompletion  
**Extension ID:** `christian-kohler.path-intellisense`

---

## 6. Auto Rename Tag
If you work with HTML or JSX, this extension will save you time. Rename an opening tag and the closing tag updates automatically.

**Use for:** Auto-updating HTML/JSX tags  
**Extension ID:** `formulahendry.auto-rename-tag`

## 7. GitLens — Git Supercharged

## 9. Import Cost
Curious about how heavy a package is? Import Cost shows the size of your imports right in the editor — very useful for performance-conscious developers.

**Use for:** Tracking package size in real-time  
**Extension ID:** `wix.vscode-import-cost`
